# Codecamy Mixed Messages

This is a very simple solution to the first ever portfolio project on Codecamy. Changes will be made further down the line which will include the utilization of more complex data structures, user inputs and a fully functional webpage.

+ Data structures

## How to test this code?

Simply download the script named `index.js` and run using a terminal.
